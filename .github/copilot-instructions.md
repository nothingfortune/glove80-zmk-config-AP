# Copilot Instructions for Glove80 ZMK Config

## Keyboard Layout Sync

**Important:** This Glove80 keymap should be kept in sync with the sliceMK keyboard layout.

When making changes to this config:
1. Consider equivalent changes needed for the sliceMK layout
2. Use consistent layer structures, home row mod timings, and custom behaviors across both keyboards
3. The sliceMK ErgoDox configuration is referenced at: https://github.com/nothingfortune/unified-zmk-config-template-sliceMK

## Key Features

- Home row mods (GACS: Gui-Alt-Ctrl-Shift)
- Auto-pair macros for brackets/quotes
- Mouse keys with scroll wheel
- macOS-optimized shortcuts (Option+Arrow for word jump, etc.)
